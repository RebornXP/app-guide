![](https://ahrefs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/blog-javascript-seo-400x200.png)
A guide for developers on publishing their web app to the RebornXP Appstore

# Introduction
This guide contains the rules & template for creating a RebornXP supportable program. After you fork & modify the template according to your web app, you can mail me an attachment at [m.shoaib.jamal@outlook.com](m.shoaib.jamal@outlook.com) and after going through some checks (usually takes up to a week), your app will be uploaded to the Store. Please make it clear that your app may be rejected if it does not meet our standards - See Developer Policy

# Where is the template?
The template can be found in this repo (appname.js)

# Developer Policy
## 1. Restricted Content
Before submitting an app to Store, ensure it complies with these content policies and with local laws. 
- Should not contain inappropriate content
- App must not link with any real money gambling
- No unapproved substances
- No child endangerment
## 2. Impersonation
When developers impersonate others or their apps, it misleads users and hurts the developer community. We prohibit apps that mislead users by impersonating someone else.
## 3. Intellectual Property
When developers copy someone else's work or deceive users, it hurts users and the developer community. Don't rely on misleading or unfair use of other people's work.
## 4. Malware
Malware is any code that could put a user, a user's data, or a device at risk. Because Malware is potentially harmful to users, apps containing Malware are strictly prohibited from Appstore.
## 5. Families
Before submitting an app that targets children to the Store, you are responsible for ensuring your app is appropriate for children and compliant with all relevant laws.
